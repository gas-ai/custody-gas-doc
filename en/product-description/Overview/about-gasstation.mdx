GasStation is a service platform on the TRON network that provides **Energy and Bandwidth leasing**.  
With GasStation, users can lease or delegate Energy and Bandwidth without freezing TRX or stocking a large amount of resources. They can obtain the resources required for transactions **quickly and at a low cost**, which reduces fees and improves transaction success rates.  
We offer **Quick Rent**, **Auto Rent**, and **API Rent** as three distinct leasing options.

## What Problems Does GasStation Solve?

Every action on the TRON network consumes resources:

- **Bandwidth**: Used for regular transfers and basic operations  
- **Energy**: Required for smart contract execution (for example, USDT transfers)

If the address lacks sufficient resources, **TRX burning fees** will be charged (higher costs).

GasStation’s goal is to **prepare resources in advance at a price far lower than burning TRX, so you can avoid expensive on-chain fees**.

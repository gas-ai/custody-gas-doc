GasStation’s three core capabilities each address different scenarios.  
The product includes:

1. **Quick Rent**  
2. **Auto Rent**  
3. **API Rent**

Use the following examples for guidance and adapt them to your own workflows.

---

# 1. Quick Rent

Quick Rent serves **temporary, occasional, low-frequency, single-time** resource needs. Users can rent on demand without freezing TRX.

---

## **Scenario 1: Occasional USDT (TRC20) Transfers Without Energy**

The user rarely uses TRON. When they need to transfer USDT, the address is short on Energy and burning TRX would be costly.

👉 Lease 10–30 minutes of Energy with Quick Rent to finish the transfer.

---

## **Scenario 2: Temporary DApp Interactions**

The user occasionally joins a DApp to stake, swap, or synthesize assets but lacks Energy.

👉 Quick Rent adds enough Energy for a one-time contract execution.

---

## **Scenario 3: New Wallet Lacks Base Resources**

Newly created wallets typically have no Bandwidth or Energy, causing basic transfers to fail.

👉 Use Quick Rent to activate the address immediately.

---

---

# 2. Auto Rent

Auto Rent is built for **medium-to-high-frequency operations with predictable consumption**.  
The system monitors thresholds in real time and tops up automatically.

---

## **Scenario 1: Exchange / Custody Withdrawal Top-Ups**

Hot wallets run withdrawals all day, and low Energy leads to failed transactions.

👉 Auto Rent replenishes resources whenever they drop below the threshold, keeping withdrawals smooth.

---

## **Scenario 2: DApp Backend Addresses with Heavy Contract Calls**

Some DApps interact with the chain constantly; a resource shortage impacts user experience.

👉 Auto Rent maintains the backend resources so contract calls stay reliable.

---

## **Scenario 3: Batch Operations (Airdrops / Rebates / Mass Transfers)**

Batch tasks require a steady supply of Energy to avoid interruptions.

👉 Auto Rent prevents scripts from pausing or failing due to insufficient resources.

---

---

# 3. API Rent

API Rent targets **enterprise integrations** such as exchanges, DApp backends, and clearing systems.  
Your systems can trigger top-ups automatically via API.

---

## **Scenario 1: Withdrawal Systems Auto Top-Up**

Before sending funds on-chain, the withdrawal system checks Energy levels. If insufficient, it triggers an automatic API top-up.

👉 Withdrawals become fully automated with no manual steps.

---

## **Scenario 2: Gasless DApp Experience**

Backend services top up Energy before executing smart contracts, so end users never deal with resource concepts.

👉 Better user experience, fewer failures due to lack of Energy.

---

## **Scenario 3: Long-Running Scripts / Bots / Scheduled Jobs**

Bots, clearing tasks, or batch scripts need resources throughout their lifecycle.

👉 API Rent keeps resources sufficient while the processes run.

# Summary

| Capability | Core Value | Typical Scenarios |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Quick Rent** | On-demand, no TRX freeze | One-off transfer / DApp action / New address activation |
| **Auto Rent** | Continuous top-ups, stable operations | Withdrawal top-ups / High-frequency DApps / Batch tasks |
| **API Rent** | Fully automated integration | Withdrawal systems / Gasless DApps / Backend scripts |

With these three approaches, GasStation serves users ranging from individuals to DApps and enterprise platforms—covering everything from one-time actions to fully automated resource management.

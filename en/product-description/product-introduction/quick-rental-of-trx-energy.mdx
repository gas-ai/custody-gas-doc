# What Is Quick Rent?

Quick Rent lets you lease resources for a TRON address on demand. It is pay-as-you-go and ready to use immediately. It’s perfect for temporary or occasional actions such as infrequent user transfers or DApp operations.

# When Should You Use Quick Rent?

Quick Rent is designed for **temporary, occasional, low-frequency, one-off** needs—or whenever you **don’t want to freeze TRX**.

Here are a few scenarios to help you decide when Quick Rent is the best fit.

---

**Example 1: Occasional USDT (TRC20) Transfers Without Energy**

The user rarely sends transactions on TRON.  
When they need to transfer USDT, the address lacks Energy and the network will burn a significant amount of TRX as fees.

👉 Use **Quick Rent** to purchase short-term Energy (for example, 30 minutes or 1 hour) and complete the transfer at a much lower cost.

---

**Example 2: Temporary DApp Contract Interaction**

The user occasionally opens a DApp to stake, swap, or craft assets.  
Without Energy, the transaction cannot be executed.

👉 Use **Quick Rent** to replenish Energy, then run the contract call immediately.

---

**Example 3: “Activating” a New Wallet**

New addresses usually have zero Bandwidth/Energy, so even basic TRX transfers may fail.

👉 Use **Quick Rent** to add the basic resources and make the address usable right away.

---

**Example 4: Short-Term Batch Transfers (Airdrops / Rewards / Rebates)**

Merchants, agents, or project teams occasionally need to execute a large number of transfers in a short window.

👉 Lease a large amount of Energy for a short period via Quick Rent,  
then batch-complete the airdrops or transfers without paying high TRX fees.

---

**Summary**

**If you rarely use TRON but must perform a transaction today, Quick Rent is for you.**

# Quick Rent Step-by-Step Guide

Quick Rent is ideal for temporary TRON operations such as USDT transfers or DApp interactions.

### **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**

1. Open the Quick Rent page  
2. Click **“Connect Wallet”** (currently supports TronLink)
![Connect Wallet](/en/images/product-description/LinkWallet.png)
After connecting, the system reads your resource status (whether Bandwidth/Energy is sufficient).

> **Why connect a wallet?**  
> GasStation needs to delegate the leased resources to your address so you can use them instantly.

---

### **Step 2: Choose the Amount of Energy You Need**

![Choose Energy](/en/images/product-description/quick-rental-1.png)
Enter the amount of Energy you want to lease in “Resource Amount,” or simply input the expected number of transactions. The system will automatically recommend an Energy value.

**Reference guide:**

- **1 USDT (TRC20) transfer**  
  ⚡ Requires roughly 15,000 – 30,000 Energy  
- **2–3 transfers or DApp interactions**  
  ⚡ Recommend 40,000 – 60,000 Energy  
- **Complex contracts / mint / swap operations**  
  ⚡ Recommend 80,000 Energy or above

> **Why estimate the count?**  
> Each transfer or contract call consumes Energy. Renting enough in a single order prevents repeated purchases and avoids transaction failures.

---

### **Step 3: Select the Leasing Duration (Critical)**
![Select Duration](/en/images/product-description/quick-rental-2.png)

Choose from multiple durations—for example 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, or 1 day. Longer periods cost more, so match the duration to your needs.

- **One-time transfer → 10–30 minutes is enough**  
- **Multiple operations expected → 1 hour is safer**  
- **DApp interactions over a longer period → Consider 3 hours or more**

> **Why does duration matter?**  
> The leased resources remain valid only within the rent period.  
> The longer the duration, the longer your resources stay available—so you can complete transactions without timing out.

---

### **Step 4: Enter the Recipient Address**
![Target Address](/en/images/product-description/quick-rental-3.png)

Fill in the address that should receive the resources in “Target Address.”

Typically:

- Renting for yourself → your wallet address is auto-filled  
- Renting for someone else → enter their address manually

> ⚠ **Important:**  
> Once delegated, resources cannot be moved to another address. Make sure the address is correct.

---

### **Step 5: Enable “Auto Activate” (Recommended)**
![Auto Activate](/en/images/product-description/quick-rental-4.png)

Turn on **“Auto Activate”** before submitting the order.

**Why enable it?**

- Delegated Energy on TRON may require an on-chain activation step  
- Without auto activation, you might need to click “Activate” manually  
- Auto activation ensures the resources are ready the moment they arrive  
- It prevents the common “Resources leased but still can’t transfer” issue

> **In short:**  
> Auto activation = GasStation prepares the address for you → no extra steps needed.

---

### **Step 6: Review and Pay**

1. Confirm the resource amount, duration, and recipient address. Choose a payment method.
![Payment Options](/en/images/product-description/quick-rental-8.png)
Paying with wallet balance deducts directly from the connected wallet.

2. Select account balance and click **“Purchase.”** The cost is deducted from your account balance.

# What Scenarios is Quick Rental Suitable For?

Quick Rental is suitable for **temporary, occasional, low-frequency, one-time** or **no desire to freeze TRX** resource requirement scenarios.

Below are several typical examples to help you understand when to use "Quick Rental."

---

**Example 1: Occasionally Transferring USDT (TRC20) but No Energy Available**

Users rarely transfer on TRON normally.  
When needing to transfer USDT that day, they find their address has no energy, and transaction fees would directly burn a large amount of TRX.

👉 Use **Quick Rental** to purchase short-term energy (e.g., 10 minutes / 30 minutes), complete the transfer immediately with lower cost.

---

**Example 2: Using DApp, Needing to Temporarily Execute Smart Contracts**

Users occasionally open a DApp and need to participate in contract operations such as staking, exchanging, etc.  
But the address has no energy and cannot execute.

👉 Use **Quick Rental** to temporarily replenish energy → Execute contract operations immediately.

---

**Example 3: New Wallet Address Needs "Activation"**

New addresses are usually in an unactivated state, without resources such as bandwidth/energy.

👉 Use **Quick Rental** to supplement basic resources, making the address immediately usable (activated).

---

**Example 4: Temporarily Needing Batch Transfers (Airdrops / Red Packets / Rebates)**

Merchants, agents, or project parties occasionally need to execute a large number of transfers within a short time.

👉 Purchase a large amount of energy for a short time through Quick Rental,  
Complete airdrops and transfers in batches, avoiding excessive TRX transaction fees.

---



**Summary**

**If you use energy infrequently or have temporary energy usage needs, Quick Rental is suitable for you.**

### **Step 1: Connect Wallet**

1. Open the Quick Rental page  
2. Click **「Connect Wallet」** Currently supports TronLink
![LinkWallet.png](/images/product-description/LinkWallet.png)
After connecting, the system will read your address resource status.

> **Why Connect Wallet?**  
> After connecting the wallet, the system will create an account for you. You can directly use the wallet to pay for purchasing resources or recharge the account using the wallet.

---

### **Step 2: Choose Rental Energy Based on Transfer Frequency**

![quick-rental-1.png](/images/product-description/quick-rental-1.png)
Select the energy value you need to lease in the "Resource Quantity" input box. Or directly fill in your estimated frequency based on the estimated number of times. The system will automatically provide you with specific energy recommendations.

**Selection Reference Method:**

- **1 USDT(TRC20) Transfer**  
  ⚡ Generally requires about 64,400 Energy  (If the receiving address does not have USDT, the first transfer generally requires about 130,400 Energy)

> **Why Estimate Frequency?**  
> Each transfer or contract call consumes energy. The system estimates how many transfers the current energy amount can support for you, avoiding repeated orders due to insufficient energy and ensuring transactions won't fail.

---

### **Step 3: Choose Rental Duration (Very Important)**
![quick-rental-2.png](/images/product-description/quick-rental-2.png)

The system supports multiple lease periods: such as 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day, etc. The longer the time, the relatively higher the cost. Choosing the duration according to actual needs can maximize resource utilization.

- **Temporarily transfer once → 10~30 minutes is sufficient**  
- **Expecting multiple operations → 1 hour is more reliable**  
- **It is recommended to reasonably choose the time according to your business needs**

> **Why Choose Duration?**  
> Leased resources are valid during the lease period.  
> The longer the duration, the longer resources remain available, allowing you to execute transactions at any time without transaction failure due to exceeding the rental time.

---

### **Step 4: Fill in the Address Receiving Resources**
![quick-rental-3.png](/images/product-description/quick-rental-3.png)

Fill in the address needing resources in the "Target Address" input box. After connecting the wallet, the system will automatically fill in your wallet address.

Under normal circumstances:

- If you are renting for your own address → Fill in your own address (the system will automatically fill in the wallet address you connected) 
- If you need to rent resources for others → You can fill in the other party's address

> ⚠ Note  
> Once resources are delegated, they cannot be transferred to other addresses or stopped midway. Please ensure correct filling.

---

### **Step 5: Enable "Auto-Activation" (Recommended)**
![quick-rental-4.png](/images/product-description/quick-rental-4.png)

Before submitting the order, it is recommended to turn on the **「Auto-Activation」** switch.


**Why Enable:**

In the TRON network, a new address needs to be "activated" before first use, meaning confirming to the blockchain that this address is normally used.

You can enable the auto-activation function:

1.After enabling, the platform will automatically check if your address is activated;

2.If not yet activated, the platform will automatically transfer 0.000001 TRX to the address to help you complete activation;

3.After successful activation, the platform will automatically delegate resources for you, requiring no action from you.

Activation consumes 1.1 TRX network fee, which is charged by the blockchain, with no additional platform fees.

Activation is one-time. Once activated, the address remains valid afterwards with no repeated charges.

> **Simply put:**  
> Enabling auto-activation = The system prepares your address for you → No additional operations needed from you.

---

### **Step 6: Confirm and Pay**

1. Confirm resource quantity, lease period, and receiving address are correct. Choose payment method.

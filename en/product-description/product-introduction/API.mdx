## 🚀 1. What Can the API Do?

The API’s mission is simple:  
**Automatically top up Energy / Bandwidth for your addresses so you never have to place manual orders.**

### 🔧 Core Capabilities at a Glance

#### **1) Automatically Create Leasing Orders**
- Supports both Energy and Bandwidth
- Auto top-up with no manual action required

#### **2) Check Order & Resource Status**
- Confirm whether an order succeeded
- Verify that resources were delegated to the target TRON address

#### **3) Pull Real-Time Resource Data**
- Query current prices for Energy / Bandwidth
- Check quotas, availability, and range limits

#### **4) Batch Operations**
- Create orders in bulk  
- Query statuses in bulk  
- Designed for large institutions or system tasks

#### **5) Estimate Transaction Energy Consumption**
- Predict Energy usage based on the transaction HEX  
- Decide automatically whether a top-up is needed

#### **6) API Token Authentication**
- Secure backend integration  
- Rate limiting, permissions, and allowlists

## 👥 2. Who Is the API For?

Gas API is built for users or enterprises **with automation needs and heavy on-chain activity**.

### ✔ Perfect for

#### **• Exchanges / Custodians**
- Large volumes of withdrawals and internal transfers  
- Automatic top-ups lower failure rates

#### **• DApps / Smart Contract Platforms**
- Deliver a “Gasless” experience for users  
- Avoid failed transactions caused by insufficient Energy

#### **• Enterprise Wallets / Multi-Address Management**
- Operate hundreds or thousands of business addresses  
- Keep each address at the required resource level automatically

#### **• Automation Scripts / Bots / Scheduled Jobs**
- Batch airdrops or minting  
- Automated clearing and scheduled tasks

### ✘ Not Ideal For

#### **• Individual Users**
- It’s simpler to purchase or lease resources directly on the front-end  
- No need to integrate the API

## 🧩 3. Typical Scenarios

### **Scenario A: Exchange Auto Top-Up (Most Common)**
1. A user requests a withdrawal  
2. The system detects low Energy on the address  
3. The API automatically creates an order  
4. Once the delegation is completed, the withdrawal is executed

> **Result:** Lower failure rates and less manual work.

---

### **Scenario B: DApp Gasless Mode**
1. The user initiates a smart contract operation  
2. The backend detects insufficient Energy  
3. Automatic top-up → execute the transaction  
4. Users do not feel the process and do not need to understand resource concepts

> **Result:** Outstanding user experience.

## 🚀 1. What Functions Can the API Realize?

The core goal of the API is:  
**Enable systems to automatically replenish energy/bandwidth for addresses without requiring manual order placement.**

### 🔧 Overview of Core Capabilities

#### **1) Automatically Create Rental Orders**
- Support for energy/bandwidth
- Automatic energy replenishment without manual triggering

#### **2) Query Orders and Resource Status**
- Check if orders are successful
- Whether resources have been delegated to the specified TRON address

#### **3) Obtain Real-time Resource Information**
- Query current prices (energy/bandwidth)
- Query quotas, available quantities, and interval limits

#### **4) Batch Processing Capabilities**
- Batch order creation  
- Batch status queries  
- Suitable for large institutions/system tasks

#### **5) Transaction Energy Consumption Estimation**
- Estimate energy consumption based on transaction HEX  
- Automatically determine if energy replenishment is needed

#### **6) API Token Authentication**
- Secure backend system integration  
- Rate limiting, permissions, whitelist controls

## 👥 2. Applicable User Types

The Gas API targets users or enterprises with **automation needs and large volumes of on-chain operations**.

### ✔ Particularly Suitable for the Following Users

#### **• Exchanges / Custodian Institutions**
- Large volume of withdrawals, internal transfers  
- Automatic energy replenishment reduces failure rates

#### **• DApps / Contract Platforms**
- Provide users with "Gasless" operation experience  
- Prevent transaction failures due to insufficient energy

#### **• Enterprise-grade Wallets / Multi-address Management Systems**
- Manage hundreds or thousands of business addresses  
- Automatically maintain resource levels for each address

#### **• Automation Scripts / Bots / Scheduled Tasks**
- Batch airdrops, batch minting  
- Automatic settlements, automatic task execution

### ✘ Less Suitable Users

#### **• Ordinary Individual Users**
- It is recommended to directly purchase/lease manually on the frontend page  
- No need to integrate the API

## 🧩 3. Typical Usage Scenario Examples

### **Scenario A: Automatic Consolidation (Most Important)**
1. Develop your own consolidation strategy through the API
2. When the strategy is triggered, automatic consolidation can occur. (If the consolidation address has insufficient energy, automatic delegation can happen)

> **Effect:** During automatic consolidation, TRX will not be burned due to insufficient energy in the consolidation address

### **Scenario B: Exchange Automatic Energy Replenishment**
1. User initiates withdrawal  
2. System detects insufficient energy in the address  
3. Automatically call API to create order  
4. Execute withdrawal after successful resource delegation

> **Effect:** Reduce failure rates and minimize manual intervention.

---

### **Scenario C: DApp Gasless Mode**
1. User clicks to execute contract  
2. Backend detects insufficient energy  
3. Automatically replenish energy → Execute transaction  
4. User has no awareness, no need to understand resource concepts

> **Effect:** Excellent user experience.

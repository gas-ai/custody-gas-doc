## How the Service Works

**1. User Payment Triggers Demand**
When your user transfers TRX (e.g., **5 TRX**) to your preset wallet address, it represents completing an energy purchase.

**2. System Automatically Deducts Fees and Distributes Energy**
After the transfer arrives, the system will automatically complete the following operations:

- Deduct the actual cost (e.g., **2 TRX**) from your GasStation.ai account balance
- Instantly distribute the corresponding amount of energy to the user's address (e.g., **64,000 Energy**)
- No manual intervention required throughout the process

**3. You Earn Spread Profit**
Calculated with the example:

- User payment: **5 TRX**
- Actual cost: **2 TRX**
- Your profit: **3 TRX**

Profits are automatically settled with clear and transparent logic.

<Note>
To ensure user experience, please ensure your account balance is **≥ 10 TRX**, otherwise you will not be able to create subleasing strategies.
</Note>

## Service Highlights

**Easy Business Launch**
Start using after activating the service and completing basic strategy configuration. No development or complex system integration required.

**Instant Energy Distribution**
The system automatically monitors transfers and executes delegation. Energy arrives quickly after user payment.

**Safe and Reliable**
Fully automated process design avoids manual transfer errors and operational risks. Fund and energy distribution logic is clear and controllable.

**Exclusive Promotion Link**

- Does not expose the GasStation.ai platform brand

<Note>
- **Receiving Address:**  
  Please use an activated wallet address and ensure this address is **only used for energy subleasing payments**.  
  Receiving addresses for different strategies cannot be duplicated.  
  The system will automatically judge and delegate energy based on the received amount at this address. If used for other payments, related deductions and energy delegation cannot be refunded.
- **Lease Duration:**  
  The longer the lease duration, the higher the cost. For ordinary single transfer scenarios, it is recommended to choose **10 minutes**.
- **Dynamic Pricing:**  
  Cost price fluctuates with market conditions. Enabling dynamic pricing can effectively protect your profit margin.
- **Cost Price Explanation:**  
  The cost price displayed on the page retains two decimal places. There may be minimal differences in the actual cost. Please refer to the final bill.
</Note>

After creating the subleasing strategy, you can create strategies with different lease durations according to actual needs.  
(Only one strategy can be effective at the same time)

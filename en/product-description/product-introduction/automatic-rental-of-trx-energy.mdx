# What Is Auto Rent?

Auto Rent continuously supplements Energy/Bandwidth for a TRON address.  
You define the resource thresholds, refill amount, and duration in advance. Whenever an address drops below the threshold, the system automatically leases resources for you—no code or manual work required.

# When Should You Use Auto Rent?

Auto Rent is ideal for **medium-to-high-frequency, ongoing, and predictable** resource consumption—especially in mission-critical environments where transactions must not fail.

Here are several typical scenarios that make Auto Rent indispensable.

---

**Example 1: Exchange / Custody Withdrawals**

Hot wallets process a large number of withdrawals every day.  
If they run out of Energy, some withdrawals fail and manual interventions are required.

👉 Enable **Auto Rent** so that whenever Energy falls below the threshold, the wallet is topped up automatically. Withdrawals continue smoothly with no human involvement.

---

**Example 2: DApp with Frequent Smart Contract Calls**

Certain DApps (games, staking platforms, swap contracts) trigger smart contracts frequently.  
Without automatic top-ups, high-traffic periods can drain resources and break user flows.

👉 Auto Rent keeps the backend addresses supplied with Energy, ensuring users can interact without interruption.

---

**Example 3: Batch Tasks (Airdrops, Rebates, Mass Transfers)**

Large-scale batch operations can grind to a halt if scripts run out of Energy mid-process.

👉 Auto Rent guarantees that Energy stays sufficient throughout the task, preventing failures.

---

**Summary**

**Whenever an address “regularly” needs to submit transactions or execute contracts, Auto Rent is the way to go.**  
It ensures uninterrupted resources and keeps your business running.

### **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**

1. Open the Auto Rent page  
2. Click **“Connect Wallet”** (currently supports TronLink)

After connecting, the system reads your current resource status (remaining Energy, Bandwidth, TRX).

> **Why connect a wallet?**  
> Auto Rent needs to continuously monitor your address and delegate leased resources there.

### **Step 2: Configure the Trigger Threshold**

Click “Auto Rent” to add a new rule.

Fill in the fields as prompted:
![](/en/images/product-description/AutomaticLeasing-4.png) 
- **Resource address:** The address being monitored and topped up  
- **Energy lower than:** Threshold that triggers automatic leasing  
- **Energy to add:** Amount of Energy to lease each time  
- **Leasing duration:** Valid period of each auto-rent order  
- **Limit:** Custom limit on how many times the strategy can run  
- **Status:** Enable or disable the strategy  
- **Single spend:** Cost per order  
- **Account balance:** Displays available balance; click Recharge to top up

> **Why configure a threshold?**  
> If resources are completely depleted, transactions fail.  
> Triggering ahead of time keeps your business running.

---

> **Why set the amount?**  
> Too little will trigger the strategy too often; too much may waste resources.  
> Adjust it based on the real frequency of your workload.

---

> **Why pick a duration?**  
> Once triggered, the leased resources are valid only during the lease period. Longer durations reduce how often the strategy runs.

---

### **Step 3: Save the Strategy and Enable Auto Rent**

1. Double-check every setting  
2. Click **“Confirm”** to save  
3. The system immediately starts monitoring your address  
4. When resources drop below the threshold, it creates an order and tops up automatically

(Auto Rent uses account balance for payments. Please maintain sufficient balance—if it falls below the required amount for a single order, the strategy stops.)

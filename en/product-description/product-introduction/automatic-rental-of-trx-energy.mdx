# What is Automatic Leasing?

Automatic Leasing is a method to continuously replenish energy/bandwidth for TRON addresses.  
You can set resource thresholds, leasing quantities, and durations in advance. Once address resources are insufficient, the system will automatically trigger leasing without requiring code operations or manual intervention.

# What Scenarios is Automatic Leasing Suitable For?

Automatic Leasing is suitable for **medium-high frequency, continuous, predictable** resource consumption scenarios, especially business environments that require uninterrupted transactions.

Below are several typical examples to help you understand "when to use Automatic Leasing."

---

**Example 1: Automatic Energy Replenishment for Withdrawals on Exchanges/Custodian Platforms**

Exchange hot wallets process a large number of withdrawal requests daily.  
If wallet address energy is insufficient, some withdrawals will fail. Manual energy replenishment is inefficient and error-prone.

👉 After enabling **Automatic Leasing**, when wallet address energy falls below the threshold, it will be automatically replenished to full capacity, ensuring smooth withdrawals without manual intervention.

---

**Example 2: High-Frequency Smart Contract Calls by DApps**

Certain DApps (such as games, staking platforms, Swap contracts) have frequent calls.  
Each user operation requires energy. Without automatic energy replenishment, resource shortages may occur during peak periods.

👉 Automatic Leasing ensures that DApp backend addresses maintain available energy continuously, preventing user operation failures due to insufficient resources.

---

**Example 3: Batch Task Scripts (Airdrops, Rebates, Batch Transfers)**

When executing large-scale batch operations, if the script pauses midway due to insufficient energy, the entire task flow will be interrupted.

👉 Using Automatic Leasing ensures continuous energy supply during script execution, preventing task failures due to resource exhaustion.

**Summary**

**As long as your address "frequently needs" to send transactions or execute contracts, you should use Automatic Leasing.**  
It ensures uninterrupted resource supply and continuous business operations.

# Automatic Leasing Operation Guide

Automatic Leasing is suitable for continuous TRON network operations, such as DApp payment on behalf, withdrawal energy replenishment, batch transactions, etc.  
Through the following steps, you can quickly configure an automatic energy replenishment strategy for your address, and the system will automatically execute when needed.

<Note>The operation流程 for energy and bandwidth is the same. The following will use energy rental as an example. You can choose to rent energy or bandwidth according to your actual needs.</Note>

### **Step 1: Connect Wallet**

1. Open the Automatic Leasing page  
2. Click **「Connect Wallet」** Currently supports TronLink/OKX (TronLink by default)
![LinkWallet.png](/images/product-description/LinkWallet.png)
After connecting, the system will read your address resource status, as well as TRX address balance and account balance.

> **Why Connect Wallet?**  
> After connecting the wallet, the system will create an account for you and obtain your asset balance and resource information (wallet address balance, account balance, available energy/total energy, available bandwidth/total bandwidth). You can use wallet address balance for payment or recharge the account using the wallet.

### **Step 2: Set Trigger Threshold**

At the "Automatic Leasing Button": Start adding automatic leasing rules.

Example:

Fill in the relevant data as prompted:
![](/images/product-description/AutomaticLeasing-4.png) 
- **Resource Receiving Address:** The address monitored by the platform for resource replenishment
- **Energy Below:** Trigger automatic leasing when energy falls below the set threshold
- **Replenish Energy:** Amount of energy to replenish to the address
- **Lease Duration:** Time period for automatic leasing
- **Limit:** Customize purchase frequency
- **Status:** Choose to enable or disable
- **Single Consumption:** Customize purchase frequency
- **Account Balance:** Displays current balance, click recharge to add funds

> **Why Set a Threshold?**  
> Complete resource depletion will cause transaction failures.  
> Triggering leasing in advance through a threshold prevents TRX burning due to insufficient energy.

---


> **Why Set Quantity?**  
> Too small a quantity will trigger automatic leasing frequently, while too large a quantity may waste resources.  
> Set reasonably according to business frequency.

---


> **Why Choose Duration?**  
> After automatic leasing is triggered, resources are only valid during the lease period. The longer the duration, the longer the available time.

---



### **Step 3: Save Configuration and Enable Automatic Leasing**

1. Confirm all settings  
2. Click **「Confirm」** to save the strategy
3. The system will immediately start monitoring your address resources  
4. When resources are insufficient, orders will be automatically created and energy replenished for you

(Automatic Leasing can only use account balance to place orders. Please ensure sufficient account balance. If the account balance is lower than the funds required for a single resource replenishment, the strategy will stop running.)

**Your strategy can also be adjusted according to actual conditions after generation**

title: Integration Guide
---

This guide will help you complete the integration of the Gas Station platform API, including API creation, key retrieval, and parameter encryption.

## Step 1: Create an API on the Gas Station Platform

1. Log in to the Gas Station platform.
2. In the left navigation bar, select **API Management**.
3. Click the **Create API** button, fill in the relevant information, and submit.

4. After successful creation, the API will appear in the API list.

## Step 2: View the API's app_id and Key

1. On the **API Management** page, find the API you just created.
2. Click the API to enter the details page.

3. On the details page, you can see the `app_id`. To view the `key`, you need to verify your identity through signature verification before it is displayed (please keep the key safe and do not disclose it).

## Step 3: Encrypt API Request Parameters with the Key Using AES

When calling the API, you need to encrypt the request parameters using the key with AES encryption. Common AES modes include ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR, and PKCS7 is a commonly used padding method. Please confirm the required encryption mode and padding method with the platform before encrypting.

> **Note:**
> - The key length must match the encryption algorithm (e.g., 16 bytes for AES-128, 24 bytes for AES-192, 32 bytes for AES-256).
> - ECB mode is suitable for small amounts of data but is less secure. It is recommended to use more secure modes such as CBC if supported by the platform.
> - The plaintext must be padded before encryption, commonly using PKCS7 padding.
> - Implementations may vary in different programming languages. Please refer to the official documentation or SDK.
> - Keep your key safe and do not disclose it.
